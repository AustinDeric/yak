# yak_meshing
ROS package to mesh TSDF volumes generated by Kinect Fusion-like packages.

YAK = Yet Another KinFu Implementation

Meshing happens through the /GetMesh service, which in turn calls the kinfu_ros /GetTSDF service. yak_meshing_node expects a serialized TSDF voxel volume. OpenVDB's voxel meshing algorithm is used to produce a triangular mesh, which is saved as an .obj.

Some TODOs:
- Directory for generated meshes is hardcoded; change to be a ROS parameter.
- Serialized TSDF volume is very inefficient, since it's a dense representation of a sparse volume. Change serialization to make better use of space (requires work on the kinfu side too).
- Mesh normals are always inverted. Can be easily fixed manually in MeshLab but that's contrary to the spirit of things! Programmatically set normal directions when writing .obj.
- Currently uses OpenVBD's standard meshing algorithm. Adaptive meshing could be more efficient.
